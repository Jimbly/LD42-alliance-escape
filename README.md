Ludum Dare 42 - Running Out of Space
============================

TODO:
  Gameplay
    Pause?
    After polish, tweak waves[]
    Some way to over-power nodes again?
  Visuals
    Weapons fire / damage on the half-tick, so it's more visible on the bars
      Or, increases are smooth/analog, decreases are discrete
      Enemy Fire should also be about 1/4th as long, distracts from other blinking things
    Draw passengers moving / dying
    Flash HP/Shield bar red when it goes down from damage
    Do not have blue squares in panels when in Manage
    Enemies keep moving around
    Borders
    Background - space / planets / ports
    Better destroyed panels
  Sounds
  Music
