Ludum Dare 42 - Running Out of Space
============================

TODO:
  Gameplay
    Make a bunch of levels (12?)
      Narration done, still need stats!
    Make game over screen (retry?)
    Should destroyed slots become cargo holds automatically?  Or slightly repaired?
    If not, if a hold gets to 0 passengers, mark it as destroyed!
    High scores
    Some way to over-power nodes again?
    Pause?
  Visuals
    Weapons and Engines
    Weapons fire / damage on the half-tick, so it's more visible on the bars
      Or, increases are smooth/analog, decreases are discrete
      Enemy Fire should also be about 1/4th as long, distracts from other blinking things
    Flash HP/Shield bar red when it goes down from damage
    Enemies keep moving around
    Borders
    Background - space / planets / ports
    Better destroyed panels
  Sounds
  Music
